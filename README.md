# 🧬 Mitochondrial Genome Exploration (MitoGEx)

### Mitochondrial Genome Explorer: An Integrated Platform for Streamlined Human Mitochondrial Genome Analysis
**MitoGEx** is a user-friendly tool designed for comprehensive mtDNA analysis, including quality control, alignment, variant calling, annotation, haplogroup classification, and phylogenetic visualization, all in one pipeline.

---

## 📌 What is it?

**MitoGEx** is a platform application for mitochondrial DNA analysis.  
It integrates:
- Quality control
- Alignment
- Alignment Quality
- Variant calling
- Annotation
- Visualization
  
Supports **WGS** and **WES**.

---

## ⚙️ How does it work?
![MitoGEx Pipeline](https://mitogex.com/imgf/pipeline.png)
MitoGEx automates sequencing data analysis using:
- FastQC, Fastp
- BWA
- GATK Mutect2 (Mitochondrial mode)
- Qualimap 2
- HaploGrep 3
- IQ-TREE 2, Phylocanvas.gl, ETEToolkit

**Output includes:**
- QC report
- VCFs
- Annotated variants
- Haplogroup classifications
- Phylogenetic trees

## ✅ Installation (Docker)

### Requirements
- Docker
- Linux desktop with X11 (for GUI). WSLg also works on Windows 11.

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongpop-jeenkeawpiam/mitogex.git
cd mitogex
```

Build the image:
```bash
docker compose build
```

Run the GUI (X11 forwarding):
```bash
./run-gui-x11.sh
```

### Input/Output folders
These folders are mounted by default and are safe to use:
- `data/` → input FASTQ/BAM files
- `Results/` → pipeline results
- `Logs/` → logs
- `references/` → reference genomes

---

## ✅ Installation (Non-Docker)

### Requirements
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
- Miniconda or Anaconda installed

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongpop-jeenkeawpiam/mitogex.git
cd mitogex
source install.sh
```

Run the GUI:
```bash
source run.sh
```

### Input/Output folders
These folders are mounted by default and are safe to use:
- Input FASTQ or BAM → users can select entire directory with GUI application
- `Results/` → pipeline results
- `Logs/` → logs
---


## 🚀 Features

- Pipeline with minimal user input
- Multi-sample support and comparative reports
- Static HTML output for sharing and review
- Supports both FastQ and BAM files
- Interactive phylogenetic visualization

---


## 💻 System Requirements

- **OS**: Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04) and Windows (WSLg: Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI) 
- **CPU**: 4 Core minimum  
- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum  
- **Disk Space**: ≥15 GB  
- **Internet**: For updates and external databases
